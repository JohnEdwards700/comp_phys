Choose the fitting parameters A, B, C, tau, and omega to produce an approximate fit “by eye” to the data. You should be able estimate reasonable values for these parameters just by looking at the data and thinking about the behavior of y(t). For example,    while . What parameter in y(t) controls the period of the peaks observed in the data? Use that information to estimate the value of that parameter.\n",

    "(b)\tWrite a program using the SciPy function scipy.optimize.curve_fit to fit the equation above to the data and thus find the optimal values of the fitting parameters A, B, C, tau, omega . Your program should plot the data along with the fitting function using the optimal values of the fitting parameters. Write a function to calculate the reduced $\\chi^2$. Print out the value of the  $\\chi^2$/dof along with the optimal values of the fitting parameters. You can use the results from part (a) to estimate good starting values of the fitting parameters.\n"
