    "2.  Help Dak Prescott keep his position as quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. Prescott offers you a lucrative consulting fee to determine the optimum angle of launch for a pass. He can throw the ball with an initial speed of 35 m/s. Write a Python program that uses the Heun algorithm to solve the equations of motion assuming quadratic air resistance. The terminal velocity of a football is 45 m/s. Plot the range as a function of the angle. Answer the following questions: \n",
    "(a) At what launch angle (to the nearest ½o, he is very accurate, you know) should he throw the ball for the greatest range in air? \n",
    "(b) Any capable quarterback can throw a football up to 80 yards; do your results agree with this observation?"
